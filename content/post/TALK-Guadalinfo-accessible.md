title: Talk Turning local need into global solutions Guadalinfo accessible
---

At the [The 1st AEGIS International Conference](http://www.aegis-conference.eu/), J. Félix Ontañón and I had the opportunity to give a presentation about Emergya’s work on the [Guadalinfo Accessible project](http://live.gnome.org/Guadalinfo_accesible/). This project, funded by the Consorcio Fernando de los Rios, is one of the first projects I became involved with since joining Emergya. And I’m very happy with, and proud of, the work of my colleagues.

Through Guadalinfo Accessible, I became acquainted with the variety of assistive technology solutions used by people who are blind or visually impaired, including Orca, the screen reader of the GNOME desktop. I also had the chance to meet a number of the GNOME Accessibility Team members and developers like Alejandro Piñeiro and Joaquim Rocha (from Igalia), Joanmarie Diggs (Orca maintainer) and Javier Dorado among others.

Thanks to this project, I have been contributing to the GNOME a11y community, especially Orca, in my spare-time and some of my work-time. I expect to stay hacking and pushing in that community for a long time! :-)

A really nice and interesting project to help bridge the digital divide.
