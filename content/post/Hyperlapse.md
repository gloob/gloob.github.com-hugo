From last summer I start to be interested on the technology behind [hyperlapse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlapse).

Basically is a technology that take advantage of todays algorithm to stabilize the image, accelerate the action and render the missing parts with information of previous frames. I think that [this paper from Microsoft](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/cohen/hyperlapse.pdf) Research is the most interesting to start to dig on this.

I used the iOS application [Hyperlapse of Instagram](https://hyperlapse.instagram.com/) that use the spatial sensors from the mobile to build the camera path.

A worth to view it.
