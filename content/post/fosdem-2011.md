This year I had the opportunity to attend one of the main open source related
conferences in Europe, [FOSDEM 2011](http://www.fosdem.org/2011/). Thanks to my company, [Emergya](http://www.emergya.es/), for funding some of us to attend this event. While there, I gave [a talk](http://www.fosdem.org/2011/schedule/event/orca_future/) about Orca.

You can find the talk at [slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net/emergya/orca-a-screen-reader-sailing-into-uncharted-waters/) and in a more accessible format [here](http://www.litio.org/tmp/fosdem-orca.txt/).

What I can say about my first time at FOSDEM? Well, for a Spaniard used to 
drinking beer of around 4% ABV, Belgian beer of > 10% ABV is crazy :-) Aside
from the parties, I really enjoyed attending FOSDEM because I met with people
that I only know in the virtual world.

I’m also very happy to see the [XFCE](http://www.xfce.org/) developers taking accessibility seriously. Thanks to our presence in FOSDEM, we’re starting to collaborate with them and I expect to see their [roadmap](http://wiki.xfce.org/releng/4.10/roadmap/accessibility/) accomplished. You guys rock!

As a funny aside you can watch our sunday [hackfest](http://www.flickr.com/photos/gloob/5423105350/) around the application of [Mario Sanchez Prada](http://blogs.igalia.com/mario/), [webkit watcher](http://gitorious.org/webkit-watcher/), trying to make it read [build.gnome.org](http://build.gnome.org/) :-)
