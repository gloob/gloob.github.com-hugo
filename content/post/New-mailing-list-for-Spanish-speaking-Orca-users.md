[Joanmarie Diggs](http://blog.grain-of-salt.com/) and I are very pleased to announce the creation of the orca-es-list, an official GNOME list for Spanish speaking users of the [Orca screen reader](http://live.gnome.org/Orca/).

Providing ways for non-English speakers to get more involved in the Orca community has been a long-time goal of the Orca team — and up until recently, an unachievable one. Now, thanks to the support of the [Consorcio Fernando de los Ríos](http://www.consorciofernandodelosrios.es/), the continued involvement of developers from Emergya, and the willingness of existing Spanish-speaking Orca users to contribute their time and knowledge, the team is able to support such as list.

To subscribe, fill out the form available here: [https://mail.gnome.org/mailman/listinfo/orca-es-list](https://mail.gnome.org/mailman/listinfo/orca-es-list/)

We are grateful to everyone who has made this new list possible, including [GNOME](http://www.gnome.org/) for providing the infrastructure through which to host it. And we look forward to seeing you on orca-es-list!

This list will be moderated by [Javier Dorado](http://www.tiflolinux.org/) a great user and hacker of Orca.

Enjoy!
